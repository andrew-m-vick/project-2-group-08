## **Global Air Quality Index Analysis**

This project explores global air quality trends using an Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset. The AQI, developed by the EPA, measures the presence of five major pollutants and assigns a score from 0 to 500, with higher scores indicating greater health risks.

## Project Goals

Analyze AQI values across cities and countries
Raise awareness about air pollution's impact
Empower informed decisions through data visualization

## Data and Methodology

Dataset: World Air Quality Index by City and Coordinates (Kaggle)
Tools: Python, Flask, SQLite, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Visualizations: Interactive dashboard with bar charts and table, heatmap with marker clusters

## Key Findings

Worst air quality: Cities in Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, and Durango, CO (AQI = 500)
Best air quality: Ecuador (majority of cities with 'good' or 'moderate' AQI)
Similarities in AQI levels vary by region: Europe shows more consistency, while China and India exhibit greater variability

## Limitations

Inaccurate country labels in dataset
Heatmap impact reduced due to large dataset size
Potential inconsistencies in AQI measurement standards across countries
Lack of data on natural disasters impacting air quality

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into global air quality patterns and demonstrates the power of data visualization in environmental awareness. The interactive dashboard and map allow users to explore AQI data at various levels, fostering a deeper understanding of air pollution's complexities.
